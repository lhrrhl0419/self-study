# 6.031 Software Construction

1. **Static Checking**
    * In Java, primitive types: lowercase, object types: start with a capital letter  
    * Static typing
    * Documenting assumptions
    * Safe from bugs
    * Easy to understand
    * Ready for change

2. **Basic Java**
    * Snapshot diagrams

3. **Testing**
    * Validation
    * Formal reasoning
    * Code review
    * Module: can be separated from the rest of the system
    * Specification: the behavior of a module
    * Implementation: provide its behavior(body of the method)
    * Clients: use the module(other code that calls the method)
    * Test-first programming: Spec-Test-Implement
    * Systematic testing
    * Choosing test cases by partitioning
        * Disjoint, Complete and Correct
    * Boundaries
    * Multiple partitions
    * Unit testing and Integration testing
    * Black box testing and Glass box testing
    * Coverage: Statement, Branch, Path
    * Automated regression testing
    * Iterative test-first programming

4. **Code Review**
    * Don't repeat yourself(DRY)
    * Comments where needed
    * Fail fast
    * Avoid magic numbers
    * Don't reuse parameters and variables
    * Use long and self-descriptive names
    * Method or variable name: snake_case(Python), camelCase(Java) 
    * ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES(public static final)
    * Method names: verb phrases
    * Short words, concise, no abbreviations
    * Avoid single-character variable names entirely except where they are easily understood by convention
    * Avoid global variables
    * Avoid special-case code

5. **Version Control**
   * Git

6. **Specifications**
   * Exception
   * Behavioral equivalence
   * Specification structure
        * Method signature: Name, Parameter types, Return type and Exceptions thrown
        * Requires clause: Additional restrictions on the parameters
        * Effects Clause: Return value, exceptions and other effects of the method
        * In Java, they are changed into @param and @return
   * Null values are usually disallowed in parameters and return values
